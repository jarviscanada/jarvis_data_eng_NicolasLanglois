# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a curious and creative person that's always been interested in electronics. I love that I get to be just that in software development. I graduated a few years back at CDI College and obtained an ACS. I have about 5 years of experience, mainly in the game industry as a developer with two of my most-used tools being C# and SQL. I look forward to growing as a developer in a data role or a back end role.
