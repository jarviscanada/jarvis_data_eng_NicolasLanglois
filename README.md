# Nicolas Langlois . Jarvis Consulting

I am a curious and creative person that's always been interested in electronics. I love that I get to be just that in software development. I graduated a few years back at CDI College and obtained an ACS. I have about 5 years of experience, mainly in the game industry as a developer with two of my most-used tools being C# and SQL. I look forward to growing as a developer in a data role or a back end role.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_demo](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_demo)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_demo/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NicolasLanglois/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a SQL database to store hardware and usage data on a Linux cluster. The database was created using PostgreSQL inside of a Docker container and gathers the data of various machines with a bash script that runs once at the start and one that runs every 5 minutes.


## Highlighted Projects
**Hospital Patient Manager**: Created a C# application to manage room availability, patient files and worker files. Using an Access database connected to the app through ERP, the app manages a whole hospital system to assign patients rooms, nurses and keep track of a lot of data regarding everything that happens in the hospital. This application was made in school for an exam.
